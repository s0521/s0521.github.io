      <description>Scenarios: One of the operations that is often required to create a model using the Phoenix Modeling Language (PML) is to calculate the AUC. There are two main methods for calculating the AUC in PML, formulas-based and based on integrals-based.
Key words: Phoenix WinNonlin, Phoenix NLME, PML, Phoenix Modeling Language, AUC, AUClast, AUCinf, pAUC, Secondary parameter, Pharmacokinetic, PK/PD, Pharmacometrics
Formula-based AUC calculation The AUC calculated based on the formula is equivalent to AUCinf because it is an analytical solution.</description>
